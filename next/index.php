<h1>What is happening next in the wonderful world of Penguin Chat?</h1>
</head><br>
<h1>Blazing fast speed!</h1>
<h2>We know how much of a hassle it is sending messages to people and waiting 15 or more seconds for them to respond due to a slow server! 
We decided to dive deeper and create something for the fans... something unheard of. A blazing fast, stable and secure server. We hired a professional and we received professional output.</h2>
<br>
<h1>Secure</h1>
<h2>We decided it was time to take security to the next level. With new servers, comes new responsibilities... for us. We do not share any of your information with anyone. All passwords are encrypted (hidden from us/anyone) so that in case of an unlikely attack, they are hidden.</h2>
<br>
<h1>Report a user</h1>
<h2>Yep, that's right. An all new, fully redesigned report system. Who knew you could send an email directly from the game! Now you can. With a simple click of a button, you can send a report of a troublesome user.</h2>
</h2>
<br>
<h1>Next generation filter</h1>
<h2>If a user says something offensive, the server will automatically pick it up and ban the player... it's as simple as that!</h2>
